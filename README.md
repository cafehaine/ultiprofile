# Unmaintained project!

I might take another stab at this, but at the moment I no longer plan on developing this.

# Ultiprofile
## What is Ultiprofile?
Ultiprofile is a pure-lua way of creating save profiles for LÖVE. It supports
migrations, in case you want to rename a variable, or rescale a value…

It only saves the following basic lua types for now:
- numbers
- bools
- strings
- "arrays": only the values you get from a table using `ipairs()`

More types might be supported in the future (with the inclusion of binser for
example), but nothing is planned at the moment.

It is however not finished, as the migration part isn't yet implemented.

## How to use it?
*will be written when the project is finished*
